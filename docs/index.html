        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p>Africans own valuable items such as clothes, electronics, accessories, and household goods that often sit unused. With no simple and trusted way to resell, these items gather dust, get discarded, or are given away. Existing platforms like Jiji and Facebook Marketplace are dominated by resellers, making it hard for everyday people to declutter, sell a few items, and earn with ease.</p>

        <!-- <p>Existing resale platforms such as Jiji, Facebook Marketplace, and Instagram declutter pages do exist, but they are largely underutilized by everyday users. These platforms are often dominated by businesses or resellers, making them unappealing to individuals who simply want to sell a few items they no longer need. In addition, visibility and trust issues discourage potential sellers and buyers from engaging, leaving a gap for a solution that caters to personal reselling in a safe and simple way.</p> -->

        <!-- <p>Another barrier lies in the absence of a cultural practice of resale in many African communities. Unlike in some global markets where returns, exchanges, and resale are common, Africans often do not have a straightforward channel to give items a “second life.” This cultural gap, combined with the lack of widely trusted and accessible resale platforms, means that countless items that could still provide value end up wasted, while individuals miss out on the financial benefit of resale.</p> -->

        <!-- <p>Reown addresses this gap by creating a mobile-first, user-friendly platform designed for everyday people rather than professional resellers. By focusing on simplicity, trust, and visibility, Reown ensures that unused personal items can be reintroduced into circulation with minimal friction. In doing so, it not only helps individuals earn money while decluttering but also fosters a more sustainable culture of reuse and affordability within African markets.</p> -->

        <h1>The Solution</h1>

        <p>Reown is a mobile first platform that makes reselling personal items effortless. In just a few steps, anyone can snap a photo, list an item, and connect with buyers. Designed for trust and simplicity, Reown helps people declutter, earn money, and keep goods in circulation, promoting both affordability and sustainability.</p>

        <!-- <p>Beyond convenience, Reown prioritizes trust and accessibility. By creating a safe, transparent space for peer-to-peer transactions, the platform encourages people to give their items a “second chance” while earning money in the process. This solution not only helps individuals unlock value from unused belongings but also promotes sustainability by keeping products in circulation within local communities.</p> -->

        <!-- <p>Reown is more than just a resale platform; it’s a movement towards a culture of reuse and affordability in Africa. By making it easy for anyone to sell personal items, Reown aims to change the way people think about ownership and consumption, fostering a more sustainable and economically empowering environment for all.</p> -->
